<p>
  This is the ValueSet that contains all the codes in FR Core ValueSet PractitionerRole Exercice (https://hl7.fr/ig/fhir/core/ValueSet/fr-core-vs-practitioner-role-exercice) and FR Core ValueSet PractitionerRole Exercice (https://hl7.fr/ig/fhir/core/ValueSet/fr-core-vs-practitioner-role-exercice). E.g. what you have to deal with if you get resources containing codes in either of them
